#Probability & statistics basics

1)Suppose ur giving an exam with 90 MCQs with 4 options each & +4,-1 marking scheme but unfortunately don't have access to the question paper.
What is probability u will end worse off by attempting all problems i.e. score negative marks overall.

Hints:
i)Get the probability distribution function i.e. probability of getting all feasible marks 
ii)Add all the probabilities of getting negative marks i.e. -90,-85,.....,-5 

2)There are infinitely many parellel vertical lines on a plane, adjacent lines are seperated by 1 m. Now a stick of length 0.5 m is flipped uniformly at random.
What is the probability the stick will fall on one these vertical lines.

Hints:
i)Try doing this by simulating the event many times and calculating the fraction of times the stick falls on one of the lines
ii)Identify the parameters that must be chosen randomly while simulating the process
